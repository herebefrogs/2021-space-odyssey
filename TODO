- add CCapture.js for recording in-progress movies during development

game feature
============
- puzzle logic
[sunday]
  - [x] basic UI to render notes as rings
    - [x] glow effect while a note is playing
[monday]
  - [x] randomize current song's notes on puzzle start
  - [x] larger rings and trail so drag & drop is easier
  - [x] rings drag & drop
    - [x] visually drag the ring (different color again? accompany the crosshair)
    - [x] insert ring at destination (rather than  with destination, easier to reorder notes)
    - [x] mobile friendly controls
  - [x] compare current song's notes to original on each ring reordered
    - [x] if notes matches, move on to next puzzle
[tuesday]
  - [x] nicer UI to render rings
    - planets
    - star field
  - [x] ask for feedback
[wednesday/thursday]
- puzzles
  - feedback
    - [x] when notes in correct order, disable crosshair drag and reveal the song name
    - [x] bug: darth vader song has similar notes, but their ID prevent them from matching is in a place of an equal note
        => compare key/hold/next rather than IDs to indices
    - [x] may be easier if only keys where swapped rather than key/hold/next
        => would require the same comparison than fixing the bug anyway
    - [x] maybe red/warm should be high pitch, and blue/cold should be low pitch
    - [x] cursor position broken in Firefox... either debug or make the canvas full screen (even though just render the current viewport)
    - [x] tuto explaining the color, width (and glow) significance on space odyssey
    - [x] tiny ring in puzzle #1 impossible to grab
    - ring move animated would help understand what's happening
      - [x] remove hover and drag colors, since cursor is now explicit... less confusion with hue
  - more tunes
    - [x] 2001 a space odyssey (tuto)
    - [x] star wars force (short/easy)
    - [x] star wars darth vader (long/hard)

[friday]
- [x] star field
- [x] lower sound with a gain node
[saturday]
- mobile bugs
  - [x] coordinates seem to be off
  - [x] rings are too small (hover the whole ring+trail if mobile?)
- tunes
    - [x] star trek theme (short/easy)
    - [x] star trek TNG theme?
    - [x] lost in Space
    - [x] battle star galactica
    - alien
    - [x] galaxy quest
    - david bowie space oddity
    - https://vertfromage.github.io/miniPiano/pianoPlayback.html
- [x] coil
  - if monetization, show which rings are correctly placed
- end screen
  - tweet? number of ring moved?
- static noise while playing song in Firefox... (dangerous, could break code)
  - optimize formula as much as possible to avoid repeats?
  - get logic off the pointer event loop

- planets
  - color planet
  - fix planet not loading on Firefox
- [x] crosshair via CSS cursor default/pointer, grab, move/grabbing
- [x] intro screen / better font
- [x] restart / title screen
- [x] stop/resume music on tab change
[sunday]
- [x] animated loading screen, as the more songs I added, the longer it took to generate their audio data on startup
- some notes too similar to get right
  - [x] dynamic color range based on highest/lowest keys in the tune, vs static across all tunes. (bc it's not always possible to tweak hold/next without damaging the tune)
  - ring gap reflect next (more visually intuitive, but make rings harder to grab and will break a lot of code assumptions)
- [x] resume music on tab focus play all the missed notes at once, stop/start music instead?
- screenshots
- [x] update README & repo
- submit

boilerplate
===========
- key/touch press/release should be recorded outside of hero, simpler to access
  - moveLeft should be called leftKeyPressTime or whatever
- could viewportOffsets be applied one time as a translation of the VIEWPORT/MAP canvas at render time, rather than pop up in all kind of places? 
- find a cleaner way to order all the updates that need to happen
  - input to velocity
  - velocity to position
  - position to adjusted position for collision response
  - position to adjusted position to stay within map bounds (could that be done by collision or is that overkill?)
  - camera window to viewport offsets
  - updating animation/firing times and other counters <- oh good name, counters

- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- tinyfont.js? https://github.com/darkwebdev/tinyfont.js
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?

build chain
===========
custom:
- replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
libs:
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip?
  - Mac build https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool/releases/download/v0.8.3/ect-0.8.3-macOS.zip (need manual install & permission shenanigans)
  - npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/ect-bin (but didn't seem to be available in command line afterwards... postinstall failed?)
- avif in place of png/webp (not enough browser support yet)
