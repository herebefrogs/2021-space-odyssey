game engine
===========
- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- tinyfont.js? https://github.com/darkwebdev/tinyfont.js
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?

build chain
===========
custom:
- replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
- mangle properties, and use cache names to replace all values matching an object propery that are assigned to a variable (e.g. hero.move = [], action = 'move' becomes a.b = [], c = 'move'... 'move' needs to be converted to 'b')
libs:
- esbuild in place of rollup/terser (faster build, but what about file size?)
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip? no Homebrew buidl for Mac :(
- avif in place of png/webp (not enough browser support yet)
