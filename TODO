boilerplate
===========
- key/touch press/release should be recorded outside of hero, simpler to access
  - moveLeft should be called leftKeyPressTime or whatever
- could viewportOffsets be applied one time as a translation of the VIEWPORT/MAP canvas at render time, rather than pop up in all kind of places? 
- find a cleaner way to order all the updates that need to happen
  - input to velocity
  - velocity to position
  - position to adjusted position for collision response
  - position to adjusted position to stay within map bounds (could that be done by collision or is that overkill?)
  - camera window to viewport offsets
  - updating animation/firing times and other counters <- oh good name, counters

- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- tinyfont.js? https://github.com/darkwebdev/tinyfont.js
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?

build chain
===========
custom:
- replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
libs:
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip?
  - Mac build https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool/releases/download/v0.8.3/ect-0.8.3-macOS.zip (need manual install & permission shenanigans)
  - npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/ect-bin (but didn't seem to be available in command line afterwards... postinstall failed?)
- avif in place of png/webp (not enough browser support yet)
