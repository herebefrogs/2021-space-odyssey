- add CCapture.js for recording in-progress movies during development

game feature
============
- puzzle logic
[sunday]
  - [x] basic UI to render notes as rings
    - [x] glow effect while a note is playing
[monday]
  - [x] randomize current song's notes on puzzle start
  - [x] larger rings and trail so drag & drop is easier
  - [x] rings drag & drop
    - [x] visually drag the ring (different color again? accompany the crosshair)
    - [x] insert ring at destination (rather than  with destination, easier to reorder notes)
    - [x] mobile friendly controls
  - [x] compare current song's notes to original on each ring reordered
    - [x] if notes matches, move on to next puzzle
[tuesday]
  - [x] nicer UI to render rings
    - planets
    - star field
  - ask for feedback
[wednesday/thursday]
- puzzles
  - feedback
    - tuto explaining the color, width (and glow) significance on space odyssey
    - [x] when notes in correct order, disable crosshair drag and reveal the song name
    - [x] bug: darth vader song has similar notes, but their ID prevent them from matching is in a place of an equal note
        => compare key/hold/next rather than IDs to indices
    - may be easier if only keys where swapped rather than key/hold/next
        => would require the same comparison than fixing the bug anyway
    - maybe red/warm should be high pitch, and blue/cold should be low pitch
  - more tunes
    - 2001 a space odyssey (tuto)
    - star trek theme (short/easy)
    - star trek TNG theme?
    - [x] star wars force (short/easy)
    - [x] star wars darth vader (long/hard)
    - lost in Space
    - battle star galactica
    - alien
    - galaxy quest
    - https://vertfromage.github.io/miniPiano/pianoPlayback.html
[friday]
- coil
  - if monetization, drop a hint about the song
- [x] lower sound with a gain node
[saturday]
- intro screen / better font
- end screen
  - tweet? number of ring moved?
- restart / title screen
- stop/resume music on tab change
[sunday]
- screenshots
- update README & repo
- submit

boilerplate
===========
- key/touch press/release should be recorded outside of hero, simpler to access
  - moveLeft should be called leftKeyPressTime or whatever
- could viewportOffsets be applied one time as a translation of the VIEWPORT/MAP canvas at render time, rather than pop up in all kind of places? 
- find a cleaner way to order all the updates that need to happen
  - input to velocity
  - velocity to position
  - position to adjusted position for collision response
  - position to adjusted position to stay within map bounds (could that be done by collision or is that overkill?)
  - camera window to viewport offsets
  - updating animation/firing times and other counters <- oh good name, counters

- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- tinyfont.js? https://github.com/darkwebdev/tinyfont.js
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?

build chain
===========
custom:
- replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
libs:
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip?
  - Mac build https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool/releases/download/v0.8.3/ect-0.8.3-macOS.zip (need manual install & permission shenanigans)
  - npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/ect-bin (but didn't seem to be available in command line afterwards... postinstall failed?)
- avif in place of png/webp (not enough browser support yet)
