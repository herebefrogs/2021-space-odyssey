2021: a Space Odyssey
========

My game entry for JS13K Games 2021on the theme "Space".

![2021: a Space Opera title screen](./2021_space_opera.png)

Getting Started
---------------

1. Run `npm install` to install all the build dependencies.

2. Run `npm start` to build the game and serve it locally into a new browser tab. Any changes to the source code will live-reload the game in the browser tab.

3. Run `npm run build` to build an optimized version of the game, packaged for JS13KGAMES submission.

Goal
-----
Space no longer sounds its old self. Bring harmony to the Cosmic Microwave Background by re-arranging each planet rings to discover their iconic space tune.

Controls
--------
Drag and drop rings to another position with mouse clicks (desktop) or tap (mobile)

Web Monetization
----------------
Coil subscribers get exclusive markers under each ring indicating if notes are correctly placed or not.
